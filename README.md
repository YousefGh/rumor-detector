# Rumor Detector
The code is very simple (It was developed as a POC for a competition) and only calculates the similarity between two embedding vectors. The code followed a 2-day ad-hoc development due to me being busy. API was exposed using flask for the back-end mobile app developer to use.

**Acknowledgment**:
